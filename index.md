  - When we help teams ship and iterate core features, we focus on the total experience
    — not just the pixels in their app. When we storyboard, we draw what’s happening
    in the world and what’s happening in their product. We also help Sequoia companies
    tell their story and build healthy design orgs with the structures, processes
    and measurement tools they need to thrive.
  - Along the way, high-performing designers join the Sequoia Design Lab for fast-paced,
    one-on-one, hands-on projects as Visiting Designers.

    design projects for companies within the Sequoia portfolio. After the fellowship,

  fellows:
  - name: Sue Kim
    position: Product designer
    intro: Sue developed her passion in art and design at Rhode Island School of Design,
      where she studied industrial design. Inheriting industrial design principles,
      Sue focuses on design that reflect on simplicity, honesty, and detail orientation.
      Her product design work has created impact both on and off-screen and she looks
      forward to work on products that value both kinds of user experiences.

  - name: Jules Forrest
    position: Product designer
    intro: Jules is a product designer who first became interested in design and typography
      while working on her college's newspaper in upstate New York. A stickler for
      details, she likes building design systems that prioritize consistency over
      pixel-perfection. After she leaves the lab, she's looking forward to joining
      a team where she can continue to develop her front-end skillset.
